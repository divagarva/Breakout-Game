# Breakout-Game
 This Breakout Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The goal is to destroy all the bricks without letting the ball fall off the screen. The game features multiple rows of bricks, a scoring system, lives, and a restart option after a game over.
